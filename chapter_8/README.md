#Exercises for Chapter 8

##1. Read the section about `Mod:module_info()`. How many functions does `dict` have?
In `exercise_1/` there is a module named `dict_functions` that contains a `count` function. The function will print the number of exported functions from the `dict` module.

##2. Write a function to list all loaded modules. Write a function that finds the module with the most exported functions and one that finds the most common function names. Write another function to list unambiguous function names.
